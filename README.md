# About The App

The project was created to practice the basic functionality of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and the drag-drop feature. The project was created while attending the [Understanding TypeScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/) course created by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.
